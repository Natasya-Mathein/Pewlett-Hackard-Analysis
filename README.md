# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##### Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is doing analysis preparing for 'Silver Tsunami". Bobby and human resources department were tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. We will write a report that summarizes the analysis and help prepare for the 'Silver Tsunami'.

##### Results
* retirement_titles: as you can see there are employees that have multiple titles

* unique_titles: there are 90,398 unique retirement titles out of 133,776 titles.

* mentorship_eligibility: Only 1,549 staffs that eligible for mentorship program and PH has 90,398 staff retiring. It means 1 person will have to mentor at least 58 people if the title is interchangeable. But in this case it's very unlikely that Staff would be able to mentor a Senior Engineer or vice versa

* the mentorship eligibility are very low, the ratio of is not sufficient especially the mentorship between the title is not interchangeable /n 
  even if we categorized them Senior Engineers, Engineers and Assistant Engineers into Engineers Group and the rest will be in Staff Group
