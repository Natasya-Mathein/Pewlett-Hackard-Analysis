* mentorship_eligibility: Only 1,549 staffs that eligible for mentorship program and PH has 90,398 staff retiring. It means 1 person will have to mentor at least 58 people if the title is interchangeable. But in this case it's very unlikely that Staff would be able to mentor a Senior Engineer or vice versa

##### Summary


* Overall 37.6% of the workforce are eligible for retiring with the engineers, staffs and assistant engineers accounting for more than 45% of the workforce.
* The mentorship eligibility is very low. The ratio between mentors vs. vacancies is not sufficient especially when the mentorship titles are not interchangeable even if we categorized the tiles into 2 differents categories. For example: Senior Engineers, Engineers and Assistant Engineers into one mentor group and the rest will be in another mentor group. One mentor will have to mentor between 58 - 60 staff, which is not practical.
* Given this data, there are not enough employees that are qualified to be mentors.
